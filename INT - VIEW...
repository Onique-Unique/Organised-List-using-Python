Why do you want to be etc etc in our company?

i've always had an interest in solving technical issues, and i truly believe being a tech support will allow me
to refine my skills in the information technology field. 


What is a common problem you solved?

in my household im generally the go to guy whenever a troubleshoot or technical issue is present. i generally face
different issues ranging from internet connections to software. ive been faced with multiple issues before and for an example
there was a scenario there was a notebook device that kept disconnecting from the internet unexpectedly i had the trace where the fault 
was coming from and it was not the modem, it was actually a faulter internet driver had been installed on the device, so i had to disable
and reinstall the correct driver for the connection to be stable again.

Ticket Scenario:
User monitor not working..

first check power supply for any issues, connect another monitor to check for faulty monitor,
then check hardware faults such as vga/ dvi cables, then i would check display drivers.

Safe Mode:
Starts in the most basic state where most of the device drivers are not loaded and config.sys files.
it helps to narrow down where a issue may be.

Active Directory:
A service by microsoft used to manage, organize and run networks. an easier way for system admins to find and use information
related to all users connected to a network. (Consists of Domains, Contacts, Sites, Subnets etc)
Can be used to assign policies or apply restrictions and as well remove users from a network. 

Blue Screen of Death:
A critical Error that occurs when an operating system cannot function, and ending up crashing.
To solve i wil restart the device if successful, immediately update all drivers. if not successful, disconnect unnecessary hardware devices
to rule out external issues, then reboot in safe mode. I can also check hard disk for bad sectors, system restore or use the startup repair function.

Slow Computer:
is generally due to the lack of suffiecient memory,  I can start by removing unnecesary temporary files and programs with the users permission.
I can also use a defragmentation tool.

Angry/ Unreasonable Client:
Assure the client, be compassionate and actively listen to the clients requirements
and let them know the issue will be looked at and will be resolved to the best of my expertise.

Issue With Hardware Devices: eg printer, keyboard, mouse.:
Check Power Source of Hardware Device if any, Connect substitute hardware device to rule out any connectivity issues, 
update and install required drivers needed.

Virus Detection: eg computer malfunction, unexplained slow speeds etc:
It always a good habit to always ensure the safety of a system by running Anti virus detection software for potential malware and virus related problems

PTR(Pointer Record):
resolves an ip address to its full domain name. Often known as reversed DNS.

Logical drive:
A virtual storage that exists on a physical hard drive that acts independently. It is used to optimize storage performance to interact efficiently
with the devices physical units.

How does a Router Work:
Manages the flow of data to connected devices by sending packets of information through routing tables.

What is Dhcp:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, used to automate the process of ip address assignments, so it doesnt have to be manually done.
